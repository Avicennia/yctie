A simple protected node storage mod for Nodecore servers.

###Includes:                                     

#####Golden Lockbox node
_Behaves like a typical Nodecore lode shelf, but is owned by it's placer and is able to be gently locked._

#####Golden Lockbox Key
_Used to lock a lockbox, or claim an unclaimed lockbox._

#####Securium Shard
_A mineral found underground that is obtained as a secondary product of mining lode ore._


###Considerations:

#####Tote-transport
Use of lockboxes with totes is supported, but unlocked lockboxes may still be moved by others using a tote (Though they are still soulbound to their original owners).
